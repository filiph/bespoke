Download GloVe pretrained embeddings to this directory.

By default, you want to have the file `glove.6B.100d.txt` here.
That one is about 350MB (so it's gitignored).

For convenience, you can run `make` in the `filip_mcp` directory
and the downloading and extraction will be done for you automatically.
